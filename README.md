# Banking Analytics Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building an **interactive Banking Analytics Dashboard** using **Power BI** to analyze customer financial behavior across deposits, loans, and account balances. The goal is to transform raw banking data into meaningful insights that can support **business decision-making**, customer segmentation, and performance tracking.

The project demonstrates an **end-to-end data analytics workflow**, starting from data understanding and preparation to visualization and insight generation.

## 🎯 Business Objective

Banks deal with large volumes of customer data, but raw data alone cannot support strategic decisions. This project aims to:

* Analyze customer **deposit and loan patterns**
* Identify **high-value customers**
* Understand relationships between different banking products
* Provide a **centralized dashboard** for quick insights

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

* **Power BI** – Data visualization & dashboard creation
* **SQL** – Data querying, cleaning, and transformation
* **MySQL** – Data storage and management
* **DAX** – Calculated measures and KPIs in Power BI

## 📂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains customer-level banking information, including:

* Demographic details (age, gender, nationality)
* Account balances (savings, checking, foreign currency accounts)
* Loan-related information
* Income details

The dataset was cleaned and transformed to ensure consistency, usability, and analytical accuracy.

## 🔄 Data Preparation & Cleaning

Key data preparation steps included:

* Handling missing and inconsistent values
* Standardizing categorical variables (e.g., gender, account types)
* Creating **income bands** (Low, Medium, High)
* Mapping branch and account codes to meaningful labels

These steps ensured the data was analysis-ready before visualization.
